# SFSymbolsPreview

SF Symbols iOS App: This app is free and open-source, which mirrors featues from [Adaptivity](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1054670022?platform=iphone).

[![Download From App Store](./Images/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_RGB_blk_092917.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/app/sf-symbols-preview/id1614827141)

## Why?

SF Symbols are free to use, but why [Adaptivity](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1054670022?platform=iphone) costs me **$7.99**?


## TODOs

I won't implement all features in [Adaptivity](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1054670022?platform=iphone) because I don't think these <del>features</del> make much sense. It's an app, not a database.
