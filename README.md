# SFSymbolsPreview

SF Symbols iOS App: This app is free and open-source, which mirrors featues from [Adaptivity](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1054670022?platform=iphone).


## Why?

SF Symbols are free to use, but why [Adaptivity](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1054670022?platform=iphone) costs me **$7.99**?
